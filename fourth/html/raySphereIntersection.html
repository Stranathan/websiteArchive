                    <p>
                        Some time ago I stumbled across an <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/OliverFranzke/20140718/221347/How_to_become_a_Graphics_Programmer_in_the_games_industry.php" style="text-decoration: underline;">article</a>  on Gamasutra written by a graphics programmer at Double Fine Productions.
                        In it, among other things that I hope to write articles on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">soon</span> eventually, he prescribes calculating the intersection between a ray and a sphere as part of a beginner's checklist.
                        This is supposed to be an analytical exercise on paper, but let's use that as a the basis for a shadertoy style fragment shader for a visualization and a more complete beginner's checkmark.

                        There are many different resources for you to learn from, here are the ones that were the most useful to me while writing this:

                    Getting something in your head is always the hardest part, so what are we trying to do exactly? We're trying to describe a ray intersecting with a sphere. <br>
                    Let's draw a picture to help our thoughts. We all understand what a line intersecting with a sphere should be like intuitively, but drawing a few different lines immediately shows the possible cases.

                        This is a start, but... :
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">
                        "I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about,
                        and express it in numbers, you know something about it;
                        but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers,
                        your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind;
                        it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts,
                        advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be." - Lord Kelvin
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need a coordinate system to express space with numbers.
                        If we were just doing this on paper, we would be set with our choice number of any number of systems like the traditional cartesian one we learn in school, but how to translate this into a shader?
                    </p>

                        For the uninitiated this seems like a pretty daunting and obscure task, I know it did for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need a coordinate system that includes the sphere, the ray and the screen space that has pixels.
                        By convention and since we're working in glsl (directX uses a left handed corrdinate system) We chose a right handed coordinate system with the positive $z$ axis coming out of the screen:
                    <br>
		            	Let ${ro}↖{→}$, $s↖{→}$ and ${uv}↖{→}$ be the camera, sphere, and screen space position vectors respectively.

                    <img src="../misc/raySphereIntersection/sketch1.png" class="diagram">
                    <p>
                        A ray, ${r}↖{→}$, from the ray origin, the "camera", that is incident with the screen can then be given by the vector expression
                        ${ro}↖{→}+{r}↖{→} = {uv}↖{→}$
                    </p>
                    <img src="../misc/raySphereIntersection/sketch2.png" class="diagram">
                    <p>
                    It's difficult to think about initially, but this is all done in parallel, so there is a ray for every ${uv}↖{→}$.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        All possible incident rays form a frustrum

                    Our goal is to find where these rays that cross the screen uv-plane intersect with a given sphere.
                    This of course has a geometric and algebraic represention.

                        Algebraically, this will be where the equation of the sphere is equal to the equation for the ray.
                        Geometrically, this will be two distances away from the ray origin within certain geometrical constraints.
                        Let's start with the geometrical one as it's maybe more intuitive (although slightly more work):
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking at a zx-plane cross section, we can find an intermediary distance inside the sphere using the dot product:

                        Let ${u_r}↖{→}$ be the unit vector of $r↖{→}$, defined as: ${r↖{→}}/{||r↖{→}||}$
                        <br>
                        The relative position vector from the ray origin to the sphere is $s↖{→} - {ro}↖{→}$;
                        the projection length of this vector onto the the ray then is: ||$s↖{→} - {ro}↖{→}$||$cos θ$

                    <p>
                        This is nothing more than the dot product between ${u_r}↖{→}$ and $s↖{→} - {ro}↖{→}$ since $u_r = $ ||${u_r}↖{→}$||$ = 1$

			            This value added to the original projection length gives us the distance to the respective incident points.

                        The fundamental notion of a sphere (or circle or whatever dimension sphere thingy) is that the relative position length between its center and any point on its surface must be its radius.
                        Written in vector notation with a little manipulation using properties of dot products, we can massage this into a quadratic equation in terms of the unknown incident distance ℓ.

                        <br>
                        We define and normalize a sphere with our choice of ray sphere intersection equations, then we define a line segment with one end that's influenced obliquely by the mouse and the other end on the surface of the sphere in the direction of an intersecting line using that same ray sphere intersection equation.
